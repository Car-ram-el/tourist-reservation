# tourist-reservation

You can be <i>admin or user</i>.<br>
Admin will have more privileges of working with trips while user can do anything with their reservations- make, see, cancel.<br>
The files store the data so `fstream` is used to work with files.<br>
Added comments at certain places to understand the code better. Else google is always there.<br><br>
Check out the code or use <i>Ctrl+C</i> to exit the process.

Also included is a <strong style="color:gold; font-size:23px">gA<span style="color:silver">mb</span>Le</strong> code (so that I wouldn't have to create another repo :)).<br>
It's a console-based arcade spin machine where you can choose between no. of lines to gamble.<br>
### Thanks for checking out the codes!
